# User Email Display

## Description

This is a lightweight module that exposes the user account's email field in the User's Manage Display settings UI (admin/config/people/manage/display). This allows site administrators to choose whether to show the account's email in the user's profile page. 

NOTE: There is a reason why Backdrop doesn't expose this field. Account email is considered private information with security implications. Use at your own risk!

## Configuration

After enabling this module, the email field is hidden by default. To make the field visible, visit admin/config/people/manage/display and change the setting to "Visible" in the Format column.
